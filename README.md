# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

This recommender does not just match songs by genre or mood label. It tries to understand what kind of experience a listener is looking for — how they want to feel, what kind of atmosphere they want to be in, and what the music should do for them emotionally. A song is scored based on how well it creates that experience, not just whether it fits a category. The system looks at things like emotional weight, how immersive the sound is, and whether the song builds over time before deciding what to recommend.

## How The System Works

Real-world recommenders like Spotify figure out what to play next by either looking at what similar users enjoyed (collaborative filtering) or by comparing the qualities of songs directly (content-based filtering). This simulation uses content-based filtering — it looks at each song's attributes and matches them to what the user is looking for. My version prioritizes how a song feels over time rather than just its genre label, focusing on emotional weight, atmosphere, and how immersive the listening experience is.

**Song features used:**
- `genre` — musical style
- `mood` — emotional label
- `energy` — intensity from 0.0 to 1.0
- `valence` — brightness vs darkness from 0.0 to 1.0
- `acousticness` — acoustic vs electronic feel from 0.0 to 1.0
- `danceability` — movement suitability from 0.0 to 1.0
- `tempo_bpm` — speed in beats per minute

**UserProfile features used:**
- `favorite_genre` — the genre the user prefers
- `favorite_mood` — the mood they are looking for
- `target_energy` — their preferred energy level from 0.0 to 1.0
- `target_valence` — how dark or bright they want the music from 0.0 (dark) to 1.0 (bright)
- `likes_acoustic` — whether they prefer acoustic or electronic sound
- `emotional_purpose` — why they are listening: release, escape, reflection, or focus
- `listening_mode` — how they are listening: focused or immersive
- `environment_fit` — the context they are listening in: night drive, alone thinking, background, or workout
- `intensity_type` — the kind of intensity they want: aggressive, atmospheric, aesthetic, emotional, or hybrid

**Algorithm Recipe:**

Each song is scored against the user profile in two layers. The final score determines its rank in the playlist.

*Base layer — always applied:*

| Attribute | Exact match | Partial match (same family) |
|---|---|---|
| Genre | +2.0 | +1.0 |
| Mood | +1.5 | +0.75 |
| Energy | +1.0 (diff ≤ 0.10) | +0.5 (diff ≤ 0.25) |
| Valence | +1.0 (diff ≤ 0.10) | +0.5 (diff ≤ 0.25) |
| Acoustic preference | +0.5 | — |

Genre family examples: lofi, ambient, and dream pop are in the same family. Rock, metalcore, and post-metal are in the same family. Mood family examples: happy and fun are positive. Chill, relaxed, and focused are calm. Moody, dark, emotional, and reflective are dark.

*Context layer — only fires when the user sets the optional profile fields:*

| Field | What it rewards | Max points |
|---|---|---|
| `emotional_purpose` | Instrumentalness for focus; energy + danceability for release; acousticness for escape; quiet tone for reflection | +1.0 |
| `listening_mode` | High instrumentalness + acousticness for immersive; instrumentalness alone for focused | +0.75 |
| `environment_fit` | Energy + tempo for workout; rhythm for night drive; quiet acoustics for alone thinking; instrumentalness for background | +1.0 |
| `intensity_type` | Energy + low valence for aggressive; acousticness for atmospheric; danceability + valence for aesthetic; dark mood for emotional | +0.75 |

Maximum possible score: approximately 10.0. Most songs will score between 2 and 6. A song that only matches genre and mood will score at most 3.5. A song that also fits the user's context can reach 7 or higher.

**Potential Biases:**

- The system may over-reward genre matches and bury songs that fit the user's mood and context perfectly but belong to an unfamiliar genre. A user who says they want focus music might miss *Time* by Hans Zimmer (soundtrack) if they only listed lofi as their genre.
- Genre and mood families reflect a specific cultural grouping. Placing metalcore and post-metal in the same family, or happy and fun in the same family, is a judgment call that may not match every listener's view.
- The context layer only activates when optional fields are filled in. A user who only sets genre and mood gets a shallower score, which means two very different songs could tie even if one is clearly a better fit.
- There is no diversity mechanism. The top five results could all be very similar songs if they share the same genre and mood. A real recommender would penalize repetition.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this


---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
